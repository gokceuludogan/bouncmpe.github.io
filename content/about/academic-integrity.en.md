  could be accepted by students.
- Submitting of material in whole or part for academic evaluation that has been
  prepared by another student(s), individual(s) or community agency.

  which has at any time been submitted in identical or similar form by that
  student in fulfillment of any other academic requirement at any institution.

  designed to deceive the grading system.

## Actions Against

The following actions will be taken against all sides involved in cheating:

- The student will receive a zero or negative grade for the related test or
  evaluation. In addition, the student may receive the grade “F”, or one letter
  less grade than the normal grade depending on the severity of cheating as
  judged by the evaluator, for the related course. For example, an organized
  cheating action in a final exam may result in “F” grade.
- The responsible instructor will file for the disciplinary action. Students
  must already be aware of related clauses of YÖK Disiplin Yönetmeliği.
- The student will not be issued any letter of reference by any instructor of
  the department.
- The student may not be accepted to any further graduate program such as the MS
  and PhD programs in the department.
- The student’s name, the course, the year and the semester and the specific
  cheating behaviour will be logged in a departmental database for further
  reference to the student.
- Regarding students of other departments, the respective department will also
  be informed of the specific cheating behavior.
