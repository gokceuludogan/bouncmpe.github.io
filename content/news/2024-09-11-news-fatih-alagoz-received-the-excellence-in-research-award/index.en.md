Boğaziçi University Foundation (BÜVAK) rewards scientists who make a difference with their research activities and publications at Boğaziçi University every year. This year, seven scientists in the senior and junior categories received the BÜVAK Academy Excellence Award. The Academic Board, which takes part in the determination of the scientists who receive the award, evaluates the national and international publication performances of the academicians. In this context, where different types of publications are published, their number, continuity and the number of citations they receive according to leading indexes are examined.
