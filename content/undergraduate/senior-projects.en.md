Our senior-year students in computer engineering demonstrate their brilliance and skills through a variety of specialized senior projects. These projects showcase their proficiency in areas such as software/system development, hardware design, robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. From applying cutting-edge algorithms and designing advanced computer systems to developing innovative software applications and addressing robotic challenges, our computer engineering seniors push the boundaries of technological innovation and make significant contributions to the field before embarking on their professional careers.

## Project Selection

Senior students have the flexibility to choose between single-semester and two-semester projects depending on their academic goals, interests, and the scope or complexity of the project they wish to undertake.

Single-semester projects (CMPE492) are ideal for a focused goal with well-defined milestones and measurable outcomes within a constrained timeframe. {{< /card >}}
{{< card title="Two-Semester" class="border-0 py-4" icon="fas brain" >}} Two-semester projects (CMPE491-492) provide an opportunity for students to study deeper on complex topics and polish their designs over an extended period.

**Finding a project topic is a key responsibility for senior students**, showcasing their expertise, critical thinking, and creativity while aligning academic knowledge with real-world challenges and career goals. As a guideline, an ideal senior design project should:

- **Address** a real-world problem.
- **Align** with the professional computer engineering roles students are likely to pursue after graduation.
- **Be appropriately scoped** for the project team's size and project duration.
  - (This is approximately 10 hours/week per student.)
- **Incorporate** a significant design element.
- **Provide** opportunities for students to demonstrate skills in leadership, project management, technical writing, ethical decision-making, safety, and time management.

**Senior students are encouraged to engage in discussions early with faculty members and project advisors** regarding project topics of interest. They may check [**faculty members**](../people/faculty)' personal websites, bulletin boards in the department, and [**our experimental project board**](https://github.com/orgs/bouncmpe/projects/16) for this semester's offerings but thet are not limited with the listed options. Once the project topic is decided, students must proceed to complete the project registration process as announced in the beginning of each semester.

Faculty members may use [**project offer templates**](https://github.com/bouncmpe/capstone/issues/new/choose) here to add new project offers to our semester offers board.

## Project Execution

Senior students work on their project topic during the semester closely with their advisors. An midterm report is required and serves a milestone for the project. The final evaluation process considers both following best practices and striving for high-quality work. We expect students to demonstrate dedication and professionalism in every aspect of their project execution, reflecting the high standards they'll carry into their future careers.

## Project Demonstration

At the end of every semester, senior students will showcase their work in a Poster Session, open to fellow students, department faculty, and interested parties. Depending on student participation, this session may span multiple days, requiring prior reservation of time slots. Each student is responsible for preparing a poster encapsulating their project, detailing techniques employed, experiments conducted, and resultant conclusions. During their allocated slot, CMPE seniors are expected to deliver presentations accompanied by real-time demonstrations where applicable. A panel comprised of faculty, teaching assistants, and industrial participants will attend all presentations, ultimately selecting the top three projects.
