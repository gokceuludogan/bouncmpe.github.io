## Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS)

Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) courses are an integral part of the engineering curriculum at Boğaziçi University. These courses are designed to complement technical training by expanding students' understanding of human society, culture, ethics, and critical thinking. They help engineering students develop a broader perspective on the social and ethical dimensions of their work.

HSS courses cover a wide range of disciplines, including philosophy, history, sociology, psychology, literature, political science, and the arts. Engaging with these subjects allows students to strengthen essential skills such as analytical reasoning, effective communication, ethical awareness, and cross-cultural understanding. These competencies are increasingly important in today’s complex and interconnected world.

Each semester, the University publishes the list of available HSS courses on the [**student registration**](https://registration.boun.edu.tr) portal. Engineering students are encouraged to review the offerings and choose courses that support their personal interests and academic development.

## Complementary Elective Courses (CC)

Complementary Elective (CC) courses are an important part of the undergraduate engineering curriculum at Boğaziçi University. These courses are intended to support and enhance students' technical education by allowing them to explore subjects outside their core area of specialization. CC courses help students build interdisciplinary knowledge and develop flexible problem-solving skills.

The CC course category includes a broad selection of offerings from various departments, such as natural sciences, mathematics, management, economics, and other engineering disciplines. By taking CC courses, students can deepen their understanding of related fields, gain new perspectives, and apply different methods and approaches to engineering challenges.

The list of approved CC courses is available on our [**departmant documentation**](https://cmpe.bogazici.edu.tr/docs) pages.
