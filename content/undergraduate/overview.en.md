The undergraduate program in Computer Engineering is designed so that students
have a balanced background in computer hardware, software, and computer
applications, and that they can adapt themselves to the rapidly changing
technologies in their professional carreers. Emphasis is on the engineering
aspects of the field such as the analysis and design of both hardware and
software systems.

The course requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering
total a minimum of 145 credit hours of formal course work. The first five
semesters of the program are common to all students. Starting in the sixth
semester, students take elective courses in order to specialize in the subject
according to their interests. During their study students must complete an
industrial training of a minimum of 60 work days.

## Educational goals and objectives

1. Pursue the practice of computer engineering in various industrial sectors,
   not only at the national but also at the international level.
2. Pursue advanced degrees and engage in research activities in world-class
   institutions.
3. Pursue a life-long career of personal and professional growth in the rapidly
   changing computing world with ethical consciousness and global awareness.
4. Be able to assume innovative, executive, leadership, and entrepreneurial
   roles in their careers.

## Admission and special requirements

In Turkey, student placement to universities and departments is carried out
centrally, through exams administered by the ÖSYM. A two-phase standard
centralized exam, called YKS is given once a year. The first phase exam is
called TYT and the second phase exam is called AYT. During the last five years,
Boğaziçi University Computer Engineering Department has admitted students who
ranked in the top ~500.

<!-- ## Acknowledgement of previous learning

If a student has already mastered the topics of any of the following courses:
  - CMPE 150: Introduction to Computing
  - MATH 101: Calculus I
  - PHYS 121: Introduction to Mechanics and Thermodynamics
  - CHEM 105: General Chemistry
They can take waiver examination(s) to be exempt from taking that course(s).
Upon receiving a successful grade in an exemption examination, the student earns
the associated credits without having to take the associated course.

## Program learning outcomes

1. An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by
   applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics
2. An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet
   specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as
   well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
3. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
4. An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in
   engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the
   impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and
   societal contexts.
5. An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide
   leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish
   goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
6. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and
   interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
7. An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate
   learning strategies.
